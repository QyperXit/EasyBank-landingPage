## Overview

This marks my effort to tackle Frontend Mentor challenges, with the goal of refining my coding skills through the hands-on creation of practical applications

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I decided to take on this project using the React skills I've been learning lately to get more practice and experience

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned that the z-index property is not directly applicable to the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. Therefore, I had to explore alternative methods to achieve the desired effects.

### Continued development

Areas for improvement include refining my code, enhancing file structure, and improving naming conventions. While my file organization and naming schemes have improved, there is still a need to further streamline and perfect these aspects.

### Useful resources

- [LearnReact](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/warm-up-add-dark-light-modes-to-reactfacts-site-co5924409bb476cc78b0d818a) -
  The "Learn React" course on Scrimba was instrumental in helping me grasp React quickly. I highly recommend it for anyone who is learning React!
